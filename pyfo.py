    pyfo should be called with a tuple of two or three items like so:
    (element, contents, attributes) or a string.

    for a tuple:
    
        the first item:
            is the element name.
  
        the second item:
            if it is callable, it is called

            if it is a list, pyfo is called on all its members 
            and the results are concatenated to become the contents.

            otherwise it is run through 'unicode' and 'escape'.

            should be a dictionary used as xml attributes
